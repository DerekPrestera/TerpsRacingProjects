# Terps Racing CAN Module Shield for Arduino Uno

This board is a shield for Arduino uno that allows the Arduino to communicated on a CAN netowrk with the MCP2515 CAN to SPI chip and read analog sensor data with 12-bit resolution with the MCP3208 ADC chip. This turns the Arduino into a data collection CAN Node that can be placed right next to the location of a sensor and transmit its reading to the vehicle's CAN bus for logging, telemetry, or possibly use by data-driven active components elsewhere on the vehicle.
