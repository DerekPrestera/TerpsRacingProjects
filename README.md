# TerpsRacingProjects

Hello! This is where I host the projects I'm working on (or have worked on) for the University of Maryland, College Park's engineering competition team for the Society of Automotive Engineering Formula student competition (FSAE). I create work for both the Electric vehicle (EV) and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) teams.

# Brief Overview
